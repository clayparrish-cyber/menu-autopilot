# Future Features

Product ideas and enhancements for future development. Organized by theme.

## Personalization & Roles

### Role-Based Filtered Views
Different team members need different information from the same report:
- **Executive/Owner**: Financial summary, YoY comparisons, value delivered
- **Head Chef**: Cost-focused items, rework recommendations, ingredient insights
- **FOH Manager**: Pricing recommendations, promotion candidates, guest-facing changes

Could implement as report "modes" or separate email templates per role.

## Value Tracking & ROI

### Cumulative "Value Delivered" Tracker
Running tally of savings/margin improvements attributed to Menu Autopilot recommendations:
- YTD savings displayed prominently in reports
- "We've helped you capture $X,XXX in additional margin this year"
- Need to solve for multi-year attribution (Y1 savings make Y2 baseline higher)
- Consider showing both cumulative all-time and rolling 12-month

### Recommendation Follow-Through Tracking
Track whether flagged items actually improve after being surfaced:
- Monitor items that appear in Top 3 or At a Glance sections
- Compare their metrics in subsequent weeks (revenue, cost %, margin)
- Surface insights: "Chicken Parm margin improved 8% since we flagged it 3 weeks ago"

### Repeated Recommendation Alerts
Flag items that keep appearing in recommendations without improvement:
- "This is the 3rd time in 3 months we've recommended repricing this item"
- Helps identify ignored issues or structural problems
- Could escalate visibility or change recommendation language

## Notes

- Avoid becoming project management software - focus on insights and recommendations
- Financial performance view should come before optimization details
- Keep the interface clean; resist feature bloat
